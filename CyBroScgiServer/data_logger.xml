<!--
Data logger configuration

Configuration file contain <list>, <sample>, <alarm> and <event> sections.

List is used for commonly repeated names. List name in braces create as many
variables as there are items. Nesting is not allowed, but multiple lists can be
used within the same variable: {cybro}.smb{smb}_current_{input}.

Variables in "sample" section are stored periodically. Period is defined for
each task separetely, available units are s (seconds), min (minutes), h (hours)
and d (days).

Variables in "alarm" or "event" groups are stored when value is changed from 0
to 1 (or condition from false to true). Alarm can be binary or analog (high,
low or range).
